# Codacy QA Frontend Challenge

Small application with a list of items, that will fetch new elements on scroll, in a load more style functionality.

The objective of this challenge,
is to write tests that will ensure the solution works correctly and is very future proof.
You can go from end-to-end, to unit and do as many as you think necessary,

The app contains two main bugs, on purpose :wink:, that would be nice to catch in those tests.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
